## 📌 About the Project
I started developing **Showcaze** as a personal project at the intersection of music and technology.  
It’s a social music streaming platform where independent artists can share tracks, and users can “showcase” them (similar to a retweet), which boosts visibility and supports artists financially.  

The project explores new ways to combine streaming, community, and fairer economic models for musicians, while leveraging Flutter, Firebase, and Stripe to build a scalable mobile platform.

## 📌 Status
- Beta version in development  
- Active feature expansion and early user testing  
- Seeking collaborators and feedback to scale the platform
